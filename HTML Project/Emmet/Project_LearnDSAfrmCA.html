                    #include &lt;iostream&lt;
                    using namespace std;
                    int main(){
                        cout&lt;&lt;"Hello, World!"&lt;&lt;endl;
                        return 0;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <ul>
                <li>#include &lt;iostream&lt; This includes the input/output stream library, allowing the use of cout for output and cin for input.</li>
                <li>using namespace std;: This line allows access to the standard library features without prefixing them with std::</li>
                <li>int main(): The entry point of every C++ program.</li>
                <li>cout: Used for outputting data to the console.</li>
                <li>return 0;: Indicates that the program has ended successfully.</li>

            <h2>Introduction to Arrays</h2>
            <h3>What is an Array?</h3>
            <p>An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, typically of the same data type. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, which allows for efficient data management and manipulation.</p>
            <img src="./Media/Images/Arrays.webp" alt="What is Array">
            <h3>Characteristics of Arrays</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed Size: The size of an array is defined when it is created and cannot be changed.</li>
                <li>Indexed: Each element in an array is accessed using an index, which typically starts from 0.</li>
                <li>Homogeneous Elements: All elements in an array must be of the same data type, such as integers, floats, or strings.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Types of Arrays</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>One-Dimensional Arrays: A linear list of elements, where each element can be accessed by a single index
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: int numbers[5]; (stores 5 integers)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Multi-Dimensional Arrays: Arrays with more than one dimension, commonly used for matrices and tables
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: int matrix[3][3]; (a 3x3 matrix of integers)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Dynamic Arrays: Arrays that can change size during program execution, typically implemented using data structures like lists.
                </li>

            <p>A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Each tree has a single root node at the top, from which all other nodes branch out. Nodes can have zero or more child nodes, and each child node can further branch out into more nodes. Trees are commonly used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as file systems or organizational structures.</p>
            <img src="./Media/Images/Trees.webp" alt="Trees">
            <h3>Characteristics of Trees</h3>
            <ul>

                <li>Vertices (Nodes): The fundamental units of a graph, representing entities in the graph.</li>
                <li>Edges: Connections between pairs of vertices, which can be directed (one-way) or undirected (two-way).</li>
                <li>Degree: The number of edges connected to a vertex. For directed graphs, a vertex can have an in-degree (number of incoming edges) and an out-degree (number of outgoing edges).</li>
                <li>Path: A sequence of edges that connects a sequence of vertices</li>
                <li>Cycle: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex without repeating any edges.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Types of Graphs</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Directed Graph (Digraph): A graph where the edges have a direction, indicating the relationship flows from one vertex to another.</li>
                <li>Undirected Graph: A graph where the edges do not have a direction, indicating a two-way relationship between vertices.</li>
                <li>Weighted Graph: A graph where each edge has an associated weight or cost, often used to represent distances or costs in a network.</li>
                <li>Unweighted Graph: A graph where all edges are treated equally, without any weights.</li>
                <li>Cyclic Graph: A graph that contains at least one cycle.</li>
                <li>Acyclic Graph: A graph that does not contain any cycles, such as a tree.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Applications of Graphs</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Social Networks: Graphs are used to model relationships and interactions between individuals or entities in social media platforms.</li>
                <li>Transportation Networks: Graphs represent roads, intersections, and routes in transportation systems, helping optimize travel and logistics.</li>
                <li>Web Page Link Analysis: The structure of the web can be represented as a graph, with web pages as vertices and hyperlinks as edges, enabling search engines to analyze and rank pages.</li>
                <li>Network Flow: Graphs are utilized in flow networks to model the flow of resources, such as electricity or data, through a network.</li>
